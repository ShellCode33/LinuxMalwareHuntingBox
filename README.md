# Linux Malware Hunting Box

An easy to setup Cuckoo environment for GNU/Linux malware analysis.

You're lazy and you have been struggling with setting up Cuckoo in the past ? Well you came to the right place : I have setup everything just for you.

First, make sure you have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed.

Then, clone this repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/ShellCode33/LinuxMalwareHuntingBox.git
```

And run the setup script :
```
$ ./setup.sh
```

This setup script will create a virtual machine (using VirtualBox) with the Cuckoo agent (and other stuff) deployed inside. It will also install Cuckoo inside a Python virtual environment, and generate a clean configuration working with your setup.

Everytime you will want to manage Cuckoo, you will have to join the Python virtual environment :
```
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Then the `cuckoo` command will be available.

To start the manager daemon :
```
$ cuckoo --cwd cuckoo/
```

To send binaries to that daemon (in another shell) :
```
$ cuckoo --cwd cuckoo/ submit /path/to/binary
```

Note the usage of `--cwd`. By default cuckoo will find its configuration in `~/.cuckoo`, but the configuration under the cuckoo folder has been specially crafted to work with the guest VM.
